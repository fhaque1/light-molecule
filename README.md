Description: This site will display the rates of job creation on a map of the United States, in which each state is depicted by a square. At its default stage, the squares will be the same size with equal spacing. Below the map will be an interactive slider, which will allow the user to watch the map change through the years. The size of the squares will grow or shrink depending on that state's rate of job creation that particular year. 

Potential Features: Hover over each state to see additional information about the state regarding job creation, job death, number of firms present, etc. Each state will be colored on a gradient or spectrum corresponding to its rates. Using the numbers we have, we could potentially project predictions for the next few years as well.

Why We Care: This map will show the user which areas of the United States are the up and coming pubs of advancement and opportunity. It will illustrate just how quickly some places are booming compared to others. This can be used when making investments, or when personally deciding where to reside.
